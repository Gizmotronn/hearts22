For the second season in a row, Melbourne City has won the A-League Mens Premiership, finishing on top of the table by 1 point with a club record 49 points, 14 wins in 26 games. This React website was built to show the club, players and staff what this achievement means to us fans, and why we support the club. We are Melbourne. This means more.

# The Website
## Tech stack
This website was built using:
* Framework: ReactJS / Node.js
* Assets: CCL projects
* License: MIT
* Package manager: NPM
* Deployment hosted on Vercel

Node Packages:
* Babel
* Thirdweb & Moralis SDK
* Acorn
* Typescript ESLint
* Metamask SDK
See the full list in `./node_modules`

### Installation
First, clone this repository using either the Github CLI or the regular Git application:
`git clone https://github.com/gizmotronn/hearts22/`

Install the required packages using either NPM or Yarn:
```
cd hearts22
yarn install
```

or
```
cd hearts22
npm install
```

Finally, use the command `npm start` to view your app running on `localhost:3000`. Ensure that you've set this correctly in `package.json` and your build parameters with your hosting CLI/platform of choice.

As the Thirdweb SDK is not being utilised at the moment, no environment variables need to be defined.

Install your hosting CLI of choice (I'm using Vercel) using either NPM or Yarn and then deploy.

# The future
Who knows? I may create a new site if we are in the grand final again on the 28th of May. It will still be developed in React, however it will be a brand new website focusing specifically on City in the Community and the 21/22 season, moving away from the fan-focused approach with this webapp (fan submissions, photos etc will still be included, but the focus of a possible grand final website will be to showcase our history as a club and city). Any new sites will be created as a new branch on this repository so that any future thirdweb integrations are present across the entire archive.

A link to the Vercel deployment (https://hearts22.la7.dev) will be shared to the players & staff before the first leg of the semi-final against Adelaide on the 18th of May, 2022.
